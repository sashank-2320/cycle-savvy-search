🚀 Vahan Bazar – Two-Wheeler Marketplace Web App
📝 Problem Statement

Build a two-wheeler marketplace web app where users can browse bikes, scooters, and electric vehicles (EVs), search and filter by brand, price, or fuel type, view detailed specs with images, compare models side by side, use EMI and fuel cost calculators, check upcoming launches, explore showrooms, and book test rides or sell used bikes.

📌 Detailed Proposal & Prototype Plan

Browse & Search – List of bikes with filters for brand, price, fuel type, etc.

Bike Details Page – Specs, images, EMI calculator, fuel cost estimator, comparison option.

Comparison Module – Side-by-side comparison of multiple bikes.

Dealership Page – Showroom locator with Google Maps integration.

Sell Bike Module – Users can upload images and details to sell their used bikes.

Test Ride Booking – Form to book test rides with dealerships.

Admin/Dealer Dashboard – Inventory management, leads tracking, analytics (future scope).
